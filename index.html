    <h3>What is Go?</h3>
    <p>
      Go (known as wéiqí 圍棋 in Chinese and baduk 바둑 in Korean) is an <strong>ancient strategy board game</strong> where two players aim to surround the most territory on a 19 x 19 grid. The rules are simple: two players place stones (white and black respectively) one at a time. If a stone is completely surrounded by the opponent's stones, it is captured. The aim is to capture more total territory on the board then your opponent.
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatQuotes">
      A few moments to learn, a lifetime to master. 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Given that the stones can be placed anywhere on the board in any order, and the large size of the board, the density of possibilities is far greater than in chess. Due to its vast complexity, Go was the last game in the world to remain unsolved by computers, right up until 2016 when <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/" target="_blank">Google DeepMind's AlphaGo AI</a> defeated several world Go champions in widely publicised tournaments. Find out more about how to play in our <a href="#resources">links for beginners section</a>.

    <h3>About WGC</h3>
    <p>
      The Wellington Go Club (WGC) is a small but active and friendly community. The club has been around since [YEAR], with players participating in tournament such as the annual Wellington Open. We have a range of ages and experience, from high school students to seniors, but go is truly a game for all ages, and we can cater to teaching people of any age, even as young as 5 years old.

      Every last Sunday of the month from November to March, we have <strong>Stones in the Park</strong> at Frank Kitts Park in town. This is a casual get-together to play some go and to enjoy the sunshine. We meet at 2pm at the picnic tables near the playground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice a year, we have a <strong>drop-in hat touranment</strong> where you can do some stuff. I'm just making up words here to fill space. No idea how this kind of tournament would work, I'm just mashing keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      We welcome <strong>lectures from experienced players and visiting guests</strong>, as these are a key way to improve your skills. If you are interested in giving a lecture, please don't hesitate to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>.
