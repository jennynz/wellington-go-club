    <h3>What is Go?</h3>
    <p>
      Go (also known as wéiqí 圍棋 in Chinese, baduk 바둑 in Korean, and igo 囲碁 in Japanese) is an ancient strategy board game where two players aim to surround the most territory on a  grid. The rules are simple: The game starts with an empty board with 19 x 19 intersections. The players take alternate placing stones on empty intersections with Black playing the first move. Stones are removed from the board when they are completely surrounded and when the game ends, the player with the largest area wins. Find out more about how to play in our <a href="#resources">resources section</a>.

      A few moments to learn, a lifetime to master. 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The 19 x 19 board gives an immense number of possibilities for each move. Even with simple rules, its vast complexity made it the last perfect information, zero-sum board game that humans could beat computers. Until 2016 when the AI <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a>, defeated the top professional, Lee Sedol, in a best of 5 match.
